## Requirements
Introduction: 
 Automatic water level controller will automatically START the pump as soon as the water level falls below the predetermined level (usually 1/2 tank) and shall SWITCH OFF the pump as soon as tank is full or water level in the lower tank is at below minimum level.

Features:
1.Easy installation
2.Low maintenance
3.Fully automatic
4.Saves  energy.
5.Improves Driving experience.
6.Ideal for poor weather conditions .
## Research
Objective:
This project focuses on creating a system that automates the  viper system so that to avoid and to save those few seconds that a driver takes their attention off the road to adjust a knob while driving in poor weather conditions could potentially lead to car accidents.

Benefits:
The Automated viper system concentrates on to reduce accidents that happen as a result of the driver intending to clean the windscreen when rain is falling thereby taking the attention of the driver off the road when he or she is switching on and off the wiper.

Cost and Features
The cost for implementing the Automatic water barrel filler depends on the type of components  and other Technical functions like appearence and other stuff and its minimal .The extension of Automatic water barrel filler can be  used in various state of the art by customizing the system as per the users need .

SWOT Analysis:
## Strenghts
1.Easy installation
2.Low maintenance
3.Fully automatic
4.Saves water, motor and energy
5.Increases pump life.
6.Avoids seepage of water from roofs & walls due to overflowing tanks.
7.Reduce complexity and Time . 

## WEAKNESS
1.Vulnerable to short circuits.
2.May encounter with over voltage and damage.

## Oprtunity

1.Commercial Industries.
  
## Threats

## Requirements
Introduction: 
 Automatic water level controller will automatically START the pump as soon as the water level falls below the predetermined level (usually 1/2 tank) and shall SWITCH OFF the pump as soon as tank is full or water level in the lower tank is at below minimum level.

Features:
1.Easy installation
2.Low maintenance
3.Fully automatic
4.Saves water, motor and energy
5.Increases pump life.
6.Avoids seepage of water from roofs & walls due to overflowing tanks.
7.Ideal for difficult to access overhead tanks.
## Research
Objective:
This project focuses on creating a system that automates refilling a water barrel. Without wanting  to plug in a pump every few hours only to have turn it off again ten minutes later or as needed when it has filled up again.

Benefits:
The Automatic water level controller completely stops overflow of water from the over head tank or dry running of pump there by saves electricity and water.

Cost and Features
The cost for implementing the Automatic water barrel filler depends on the type of components  and other Technical functions like appearence and other stuff and its minimal .The extension of Automatic water barrel filler can be  used in various state of the art by customizing the system as per the users need .

SWOT Analysis:
## Strenghts
1.Easy installation
2.Low maintenance
3.Fully automatic
4.Saves water, motor and energy
5.Increases pump life.
6.Avoids seepage of water from roofs & walls due to overflowing tanks.
7.Reduce complexity and Time .
